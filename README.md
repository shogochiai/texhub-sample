# texhub

I'd like to write paper with my editor + github. And that's it.

## Installation

- `npm i`

## How to use

- Modify template files under `/tex` and `/figs`
- Add some [Tex Packages](https://ctan.org/search) to `/Texfile`
- `npm start` and see compilation result
- `open whitepaper.pdf`

## Note

- You can use English and [Japanese](https://texwiki.texjp.org/?BXjscls) at least. But haven't confirmed other languages. Conribution is always welcome and email me we you did some hack to ping me! (shogo.ochiai@protonmail.com)
