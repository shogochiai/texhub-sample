ATTENTION!

If you would like to submit an Improvement Proposal and it has already been written as a tex draft, please submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/you/your-texhub-project/pulls).

If you are considering a proposal but would like to get some feedback on the idea before submitting a draft, then continue opening an Issue as a thread for discussion. Note that the more clearly and completely you state your idea the higher the quality of the feedback you are likely to receive.
